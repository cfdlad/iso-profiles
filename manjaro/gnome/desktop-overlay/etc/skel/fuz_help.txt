- Search for files names only from default path (which is /home)
    fuz -n				(text in the files is not search) (similar to everything search and fsearch)

- Search specific path (eg. computer)
    fuz --path /			         (To linux root)
    fuz -p /			"            (To linux root)
    fuz -p /home/zorin/apps          (to the home apps folder)
    fuz -n -p /				         (Search for files names only in root folder) (everything search and fsearch)
    fuz -n -p /home/zorin/apps		 (Search for files names only in apps folder) (everything search and fsearch)

- Search filenames to edit with vim:
    fuz --edit
    
- To exit press esc

- Open matches with system default text editor
    fuz --open
