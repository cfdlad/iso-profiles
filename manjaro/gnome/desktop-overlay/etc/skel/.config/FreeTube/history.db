As his childhood trauma boils over, his mysteriously scarred hands unleash an explosive campaign of retribution to settle the score with the men who took everything from him.\n\nPacked with thrilling and spectacular fight and chase scenes, Monkey Man is directed by Dev Patel from his original story and his screenplay with Paul Angunawela and John Collee (Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World).\n\nThe film‚Äôs international cast includes Sharlto Copley (District 9), Sobhita Dhulipala (Made in Heaven), Pitobash (Million Dollar Arm), Vipin Sharma (Hotel Mumbai), Ashwini Kalsekar (Ek Tha Hero), Adithi Kalkunte (Hotel Mumbai), Sikandar Kher (Aarya) and Makarand Deshpande (RRR).\n\nMonkey Man is produced by Dev Patel, Jomon Thomas (Hotel Mumbai, The Man Who Knew Infinity), Oscar¬Æ winner Jordan Peele (Nope, Get Out), Win Rosenfeld (Candyman, Hunters series), Ian Cooper (Nope, Us), Basil Iwanyk (John Wick franchise, Sicario films), Erica Lee (John Wick franchise, Silent Night), Christine Haebler (Shut In, Bones of Crows) and Anjay Nagpal (executive producer of Bombshell, Greyhound). \n \nServing as executive producers are Jonathan Fuhrman, Natalya Pavchinskya, Aaron L.

Find out the 7 signs of vitamin D deficiency and how to ensure you get enough of this crucial vitamin. \n\n0:00 Introduction: Top signs you&apos;re deficient in vitamin D \n1:03 Vitamin D testing explained \n1:54 Benefits of vitamin D\n2:00 Causes of low vitamin D \n2:28 Vitamin D dosage \n2:55 Important vitamin D cofactors \n3:18 Prevent vitamin D toxicity \n\nDaily dosing of vitamin D is crucial. \n\nHere are the top symptoms of vitamin D deficiency:\n1. High blood pressure\n2. Lowered mood\n3. Inflammation \n4. Weak immune system \n5. Sleep problems \n6. Skin issues \n7. Low back pain or muscle pain \n\nVitamin D is one of the most important vitamins for overall health. It‚Äôs essential to make sure you‚Äôre getting enough. Unless you‚Äôre taking vitamin D or are getting plenty of sunshine every 24 hours‚Äîyou‚Äôre likely vitamin D deficient. \n\nWe also have to consider the factors that hinder vitamin D levels, such as:\n ‚Ä¢ Obesity \n ‚Ä¢ Insulin resistance \n ‚Ä¢ Diabetes \n ‚Ä¢ Lack of sun exposure \n ‚Ä¢ Lack of vitamin D in the diet \n ‚Ä¢ Aging \n\nConsider taking 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 daily. If you‚Äôre worried about vitamin D toxicity, keep in mind that if you go out in the sun for only 30 to 45 minutes, you‚Äôre getting about 20,000 IU of vitamin D, so 10,000 IU is not much for your body to handle. \n\nYou should also get plenty of magnesium, zinc, vitamin K2, and boron when you take vitamin D. \n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 59, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis &amp; Intermittent Fasting.
